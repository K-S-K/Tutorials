# WSL

## Abstract
Sometimes we need to create some elementary things to provide a proper environment for a project. As we don't perform these things every day we can forget some details and we'll be forsed to spend nights to google it. It is reaaly better to have the short form of the information in the understandable form.

## Introduction
The article covers several tiny activities:
- Basic WSL commands;
- Creating the WSL distribution of the desired type;
- Accessing to the working WSL distribution command line;
- Creating the restore points of the WSL distribution instance;
- Creating the clones of the distribution for different experiments.
